# really.css

![](https://img.badgesize.io/xenyo/really/main/dist/css/really.css.svg?compression=gzip)


A *really* simple CSS utility library.

## Features

### One-to-one mapping from classes to styles. Really!

All classes in really.css map directly to a single CSS property and value.

For example, the `display-none` class applies `display: none !important`, `margin-0` applies `margin: 0 !important` and so on.

See [Class Reference](class-reference.md) for the full list.

### Trivial values only

By only including trivial values like `0` and `none`, really.css avoids making any assumptions about your design system.

### Really tiny

At under 2kb gzipped, really.css is designed to have minimal impact on performance.
